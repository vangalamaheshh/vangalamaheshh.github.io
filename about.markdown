I’m a full-stack and data engineering leader with a hands-on approach to building systems that work in the real world — from scalable web applications to AI-driven solutions and automation pipelines. I’m passionate about solving complex technical problems, connecting technology with tangible outcomes, and continually learning along the way.

But technology alone isn’t enough. I believe the true measure of leadership is not titles or control, but the ability to empower doers, cultivate accountability, and foster a culture where innovation and integrity thrive. Having navigated challenging environments, I’ve seen how leadership can be a force multiplier of talent, and I strive to create workplaces where people can grow, contribute, and be celebrated for their work.

I combine technical mastery with ethical leadership, advocating for environments that value both innovation and human dignity — where results come from empowered teams.
